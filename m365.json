Goals will allow teams to set clear, well-defined objectives to help prioritize work. By connecting tasks to shared goals, teams achieve greater alignment, gain clarity on priorities, and track progress and outcomes—driving the plan forward together.</li></ul><p><b>New features coming in subsequent Planner updates:</b></p><ul><li><b>Project manager agent </b>will be available in all plans for M365 Copilot licensed users, including basic plans. The Project Manager agent can help teams get work done faster by executing on tasks and can help drive alignment by writing comprehensive status reports based on plan updates.</li><li><b>Custom templates</b> will allow you to create reusable, pre-designed plan layouts tailored to your organization’s needs, ensuring consistency and saving time.

Due to customer feedback on our notifications experience, the new chat feature only sends an email/Teams notification to a colleague that’s been @mentioned in the message. </li><li>The task chat experience will be available on Planner in Teams web/desktop and the Planner web experience, and the old experience for viewing comments will no longer be directly visible on a task. Instead, the task details pane will show a link to open a page in Outlook where task comments can be seen.</li><li>Users can continue to use and see the previous task comments experience in the iOS Planner app, Android Planner app, and Planner in Teams mobile. New task chat messages will not be visible in the mobile experience at this time.</li><li>There are no changes to email notifications for the existing task comments experience, meaning that an email notification will be sent to all group members associated with the plan when a task comment is added.</li><li>There is no change to the <b>premium plan</b> conversations feature at this time.</li></ul></li><li><b>The whiteboard tab for <i>premium plans</i> will be retired.</b> <ul><li>This feature automatically created a whiteboard for <b>premium plans</b> in Planner and allowed users to create tasks in Planner from that whiteboard's sticky notes. </li><li>The <b>whiteboard tab</b> will be unavailable on the <b>premium plan</b> after retirement of this feature.</li><li>Users will be unable to create tasks from a whiteboard as a result. </li><li>Any existing whiteboard content will remain available via the <b>Whiteboard app</b>. </li><li>There is no replacement for this feature at this time.</li></ul></li></ul></ul><p><b>Features in Planner that will be temporarily unavailable:</b></p><ul><li>We expect this rollout to begin between <b>mid-January 2026</b> and <b>mid-February 2026</b>.</li><li><b>Convert a <i>basic plan</i> to a <i>premium plan</i>&nbsp;will be temporarily unavailable.</b></li><ul><li> The ability to convert an existing <b>basic plan</b> to a <b>premium plan</b> will be unavailable. </li><li>We plan to make similar functionality available again in the future. </li><li>In the meantime, users will need to create a new <b>premium plan</b> and manually copy the tasks into the new plan.</li></ul></ul><p><b>Features that will be retired as we pursue a long‑term plan to bring equivalent capabilities:</b></p><ul><li>Planner component in Loop pages.<ul><li>This control, which could previously be inserted by typing /planner in a Loop workspace or pasting the link to a Plan, was one of the available options. This control will be retired between mid-January 2026 and mid-February 2026.</li><li>Loop pages support various options for capturing task information. We recommend the Task List Control in Loop to capture tasks.</li><li>After the retirement of this control, which is expected to begin in January 2026 and will roll out independent of the Planner update rollout, it will no longer be possible to add a new component of this type in a Loop workspace.</li><li>Workspaces where these components were already present will display the Planner plan URL where the component was previously located.</li><li>Tasks previously entered in these components will remain available in Planner.</li></ul></li></ul><p>While the Planner component in Loop is being retired currently, we recognize the user need around a component like this for their planning needs. We have a longer-term goal to bring a similar Planner component across our M365 suite, including Loop. Considering these discussions are still in an early stage, we do not have an ETA to share currently.</p><p><b>&nbsp;Features outside of Planner that will be retired without replacement:</b></p><ul><li>Planner integration in Viva Goals.<ul><li>Viva Goals will be retired on December 31, 2025, as previously announced.

This feature will reach general availability on March 13, 2026.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nThis feature enables users to set the contract line value on the project's contract lines. The system calculates revenue recognition based on the contract line value amount.<br><br>In revenue recognition, fixed-price billing arrangements are typically defined using billing milestones to establish the contract value. By separating the contract value from billing milestones, this feature allows users to recognize revenue based on the effort or stand-alone selling price. This approach aligns better with ASC 606 and IFRS 15 requirements.<br><br>\n</ul><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness, and no action is required.<br><br>\nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO13780\"target=\"_blank\">Calculate revenue recognition for stand-alone selling price contract lines</a>."
